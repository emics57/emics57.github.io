  description: >
    Developed a scalable bioinformatics pipeline using custom Python, R, UNIX based command line tools, WDL scripts in Docker containers 
    to process whole genome sequencing data (FASTA, FASTQ, BED files and SAM/BAM files). Used Shell scripting to analyze centromere DNA 
    methylation inheritance across generations. Used the university’s high performance computing Linux clusters to build and maintain pipelines 
    for large-scale genomic datasets. Presented and discussed research findings during weekly lab meetings.
