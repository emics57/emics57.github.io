# **About Me**

Hey! I'm Emily Xu (she/her) 👩🏻‍💻 ,<br>
a Master's student at UCSC studying Bioinformatics. In 2022, I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's in Molecular Biology and minor in Data Science. 

I am fascinated by our society's chronic production of data and the insights they reveal about human thinking, behavior, and larger systems. My career goal is to develop models and technologies that are not only innovative but also explainable and accessible, ensuring they truly serve people. I aim to prioritize human needs and well-being over simply advancing technology for its own sake.
